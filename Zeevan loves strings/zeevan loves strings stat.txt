Zeevan is a big fan of Strings.One day he was bored and started thinking of a set of strings.
The set of strings is constructed by writing down all the strings in lexographical order, having the length n and containing n - 2 letters 'c' and 2 letters 'd'.

Recall that the string s of length n is lexicographically less than string t of length n, if there exists such i (1≤i≤n), that s[i]<t[i], and for any j (1≤j<i) s[j]=t[j].
The lexicographic comparison of strings is implemented by the operator < in modern programming languages.

For example if (n = 6) the strings are (note that the order matters here)

1.ccccdd
2.cccdcd
3.cccddc
4.ccdccd
5.ccdcdc
6.ccddcc
7.cdcccd
8.cdccdc
9.cdcdcc
10.cddccc
11.dccccd
12.dcccdc
13.dccdcc
14.dcdccc
15.ddcccc

it is easy to show that the set will contain n * (n - 1) / 2 strings.

As zeevan is very bad at calculating strings , he asks you to find the kth string from the set.



INPUT :
The first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤1e4) — the number of test cases in the test. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case is written on the the separate line containing two integers n and k (3≤n≤1e5,1≤k≤min(2⋅1e9,n⋅(n−1)2).

The sum of values n over all test cases in the test doesn't exceed 1e6.

OUTPUT :

Output
For each test case print the k-th string from the set of all described above strings of length n. Strings in the set are sorted lexicographically (alphabetically).



SAMPLE INPUT :

7
5 1
5 2
5 8
5 10
3 1
3 2
20 100

SAMPLE OUTPUT :

cccdd
ccdcd
dccdc
ddccc
cdd
dcd
cccccdcccccdcccccccc
