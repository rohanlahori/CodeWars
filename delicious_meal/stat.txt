You have a large pizza it consists of K pieces, you have to eat the pizza in atmost T minutes (you can complete it before T minutes). 
For every minute you know the amount of happiness you will get by eating one piece of pizza at that minute. Also, if you don't eat any piece of pizza for some minute you know the amount of sadness you will get by that.

You can eat any number of pieces in 1 minute.

Given the amount of happiness and sadness for every minute from 1 to T output the total happiness you can get by eating exactly K pieces of pizza. 
Total happiness can be calculated as = (Total Happiness) - (Total Sadness).

T = 5, K = 4
