There are n babies in a hospital room. Some of them are asleep and some of them are awake.
The babies are represented as an array of n integers a1,a2,.....,a(n) , where a[i] = 1 if the baby is awake and the a[i] = 0 if the baby is asleep.

A baby(which is asleep(a[i] = 0)) wakes up and starts to cry if both the babies adjacent to it are awake. 
More formally , for 1 < i < n , if a[i] = 0 and a[i - 1] = a[i + 1] = 1 the ith baby wakes up and starts crying.

Your task is to find out the minimum number k such that if you made k pairwise distinct babies asleep i.e change a[i] from 1 to 0 , then no baby would wake up and cry.
